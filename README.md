# The Pushdown Collection
### V 0.1.0

The Pushdown Collection is an independent project created with the intention of providing an application that allows users to create and run every single type of pushdown automaton. As of this version, pushdown automata can be:

- **Deterministic**, **Nondeterministic** or **Alternating**
- **Zero Stack** (aka a Finite State Automaton), **Single Stack** or **Double Stack**
- **Visibly Pushdown Automaton**

The **Input**, **stack** and **Halt conditions** can also be modified to suit your needs.

This project is developed by one person in their spare time, so whilst informing J0EKW about issues, ideas and automaton they may have missed is invited, a quick response and refactoring should not always be expected
