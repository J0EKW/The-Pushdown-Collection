# The Pushdown Collection
### V 0.1.0

The Pushdown Collection is an independent project created with the intention of providing an application that allows users to create and run every single type of pushdown automaton. As of this version, pushdown automata can be:

- **Deterministic**, **Nondeterministic** or **Alternating**
- **Zero Stack** (aka a Finite State Automaton), **Single Stack** or **Double Stack**
- **Visibly Pushdown Automaton**

The **Input**, **stack** and **Halt conditions** can also be modified to suit your needs. Please see the Wiki for tutorials on how to use the Simulator.

Particular credit is given to the developers of GSAP, the library used to facilitate some of the animations seen when running the simulation. This web application falls within the requirements of the free license, as this application is available free of charge.

This project is developed by one person in their spare time, so whilst informing J0EKW about issues, ideas and automaton they may have missed is invited, a quick response and refactoring should not always be expected.

Future developments are also planned, please see the Wiki to see the roadmap of The Pushdown Collection.
